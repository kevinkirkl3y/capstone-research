# Spot Check

### "Capstone Project Epicodus March 2021"

#### by Kevin Kirkley

## Description

The goal of SpotCheck is to crowd-source information about skate spots in any given area. This will allow exact pin location of skate-spots, users then can add information regarding: best time to skate, will you get kicked out, should you bring wax, etc.  The overall goal of this product is to help share info, so if you are new to an area you can check out what street spots are around without needing a tour-guide like the pros.

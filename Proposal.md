# Name of Project: SpotCheck

### Project's Purpose or Goal:
Have you ever been on a trip, had a few hours to kill and wanted to find and skate some of the local spots the city has to offer. Now you have a few choices, you can find your local skate shop and ask some of the folks hanging out if they have any suggestions... You could look up a skate park and ask some of the locals if there are any spots they might be willing to share with you... Or if you want to kill more time than skate, you could always drive around looking, but chances are thats the last thing you would want to do. 

Spot Check is the solution to this problem:

The goal of SpotCheck is to crowd-source information about skate spots in any given area. This will allow exact pin location of skate-spots, users then can add information regarding: best time to skate, will you get kicked out, should you bring wax, etc.  The overall goal of this product is to help share info, so if you are new to an area you can check out what street spots are around without needing a tour-guide like the pros.

I am using Redux in this project to help develop a better understanding of how to create state slices regarding more complicated components. 
## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

- Database storage of spot information
- Easy to navigate and add spots to the list.
- Utilizing Google Maps Api to track spots added by users.

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

- Firebase For data storage
- React
- Bootstrap to help with styling
- Styled Components
- Google Maps for location tracking and pinpointing of spots


AWS or Heroku for deployment.

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

- User Authentication and Login
- Seamless UI
- Deployed so that it can be demoed

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
- Bootstrap, Styled Components
- Authenticaton using firebase
- Heroku, Firebase or AWS for deployment

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

I still have a lot of research ahead of me when it comes to what database storage I want to apply, whether or not I want to use C# for the backend or if I want to try to implement something completely new.

Name of Student: Kevin Kirkley

Name of Project: SpotCheck

Project's Purpose or Goal: The goal of SpotCheck is to crowd-source information about skate spots in any given area. This will allow exact pin location of skate-spots, users then can add information regarding: best time to skate, will you get kicked out, should you bring wax, etc. As skateboarding is a mobile activity it would be preferred to be a mobile app. The overall goal of this product is to help share info, so if you are new to an area you can check out what street spots are around without needing a tour-guide like the pros.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

Seamless UI, easy to navigate and add spots to the list.
Utilizing Google Maps Api to track spots added by users.
Deployed so that it can be demoed

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

React (Native) \*\* Need to continue research to figure out if .
Bootstrap to help with styling.
-Google Maps for location tracking and pinpointing of spots.
-Core Location

AWS or Heroku for deployment.

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

User Authentication and Login
Database storage of spot information
What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

MySQL or Firebase
Identity (possibly) for user authorization.
Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

I still have a lot of research ahead of me when it comes to what database storage I want to apply, whether or not I want to use C# for the backend or if I want to try to implement something completely new.
